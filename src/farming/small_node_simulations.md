# Small Node Simulations

@Roel: TODO get simulations for 3 scenarios on the small nodes.

For the nodes we have selected together with the team from Mazraa.io we have simulated three different scenarios. These scenario's have been created in the 3SDK which is available for anyone to install, it does however require some technical knowledge.

Visit the [Grid Manual](https://sdk.threefold.io/#/simulator) to know more about this.
