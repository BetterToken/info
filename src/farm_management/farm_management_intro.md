# Farm Management Intro

To setup a 3Node a Farm needs a 3Bot to manage the farm.
Since we want to save everyone that is less technical of configuring the 3Node themselves completely and link their wallet to the farm for them.
However this means the 3Bot managing the farm is not your 3Bot (yet).
In this section of the wiki we will go over the steps to add your farm to your 3Bot.

## Pre-requisites

### Part 1:
There are some pre-requisites you need to meet before you can create you own 3Bot.
You will need:

1. [The 3Bot Connect App installed to your phone or tablet](get_3bot_connect.md)
2. [Need at least a few ThreeFold Tokens in your Wallet to create your 3Bot](get_tft_from_bt.md)
3. [A Public SSH key to link to your 3Bot](generate_and_ssh_key.md)

Once these steps are completed you can now move on to part 2.
