# Farm Management Intro

This part of our wiki is made for those that just bought and/or own a plug & farm 3Node.
In this section of the wiki we will go over the steps to take full ownership over the 3Node.
To create the your 3Node we have created your farm with our 3Bot, when the necessary steps have been taking by you it will belong to your 3Bot.

## Pre-requisites

There are some pre-requisites you need to meet before you can create you own 3Bot.
You will need:

- The 3Bot Connect App installed to your phone or tablet
- Need at least a few ThreeFold Tokens in your Wallet to create your 3Bot
- A Public SSH key to link to your 3Bot

If this all sounds like gibberish to you, no worries we are here to guide you through the steps.
