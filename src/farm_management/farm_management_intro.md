# Farm Management Intro

To set up your plug & farm 3Node, we have linked it to the BetterToken 3Bot.
All nodes on the ThreeFold Grid need a 3Bot to:

- Create a Farm (and with that a farm id)
- Link a wallet address to a farm

Since BetterToken has completed this process for you it is now linked to the BetterToken 3Bot.
What CAN you do when you decide to continue to the next steps: 
- Rename your farm.
- Add another node to your farm.
- Add a different wallet address to your farm.

In this section of the wiki we will go over the steps to add your farm to your 3Bot. (This does require some technical skills)

## Prerequisites

### Part 1:
There are some prerequisites you need to meet before you can create you own 3Bot.
You will need:

1. [The ThreeFold Connect App installed to your phone or tablet](get_threefold_connect.md)
2. [At least a few ThreeFold Tokens in your Wallet to create your 3Bot](get_tft_from_bt.md)
3. [A Public SSH key to link to your 3Bot](generate_and_ssh_key.md)

Once these steps are completed you can now move on to part 2.

### Part 2:

1. [Setting up your Hosted 3Bot](getting_a_hosted_3bot.md)
2. [Finding Your 3Bot ID](finding_3bot_id.md)
