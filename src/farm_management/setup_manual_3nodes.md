# 3Node Setup Guide

**Congratulations on becoming a Threefold Farmer!**
In order to add your 3Node to the Threefold Grid a few steps
need to be taken. Once completed your node will officially contributing to the world's biggest network of decentralized internet capacity, and ready for use! If you have any additional questions or issues, feel free to contact us through [support@bettertoken.com](mailto:support@bettertoken.com)

## Step 1: Verify package contents
Inspect the package and its contents directly after delivery and report any shipping damages to support@bettertoken.com immediately.

Verify package contents:

- 1x 3Node
- 1x Power adapter
- 1x USB Drive (already plugged into the 3Node)

## Step 2: Connecting the 3Node to a power source and modem

1. Connect the power cable to the power adapter.
2. Connect the power adapter to the “DC-12V” connector at the back of the 3Node.
3. Connect one end of an Ethernet cable to the “LAN” connector at the back of the 3Node and the other end to an available Ethernet port on your home router.
4. Connect the power cable to a power outlet.
5. Press the power on button, light should provide visual confirmation that the 3Node is now running. 

**IMPORTANT: Home router ports that can be used for this purpose are typically labelled “Port 1-4”. If you are unsure which port to use, please refer to the User Documentation of the router and check which port should be used.**

PLEASE NOTE: A 3Node should always be placed on a dust-free and flat service located close to your home modem (not provided by ThreeFold). The 3Node is designed to be exposed to in-house conditions and should never be placed in direct sunlight, extreme temperatures (hot/cold) or humid areas.

## Step 3: Check the ThreeFold Explorer if your Node shows up

After completing step 2 your node is now online and should show up in the  [ThreeFold Explorer](https://explorer.threefold.io/).
You can search on your Farm's name or ID to see if it is indeed online. If this is the case you are now officially a ThreeFold Farmer.


If you wish to take full management capabilities of your 3Node in your hands you can continue to step 4.
Before doing so please know this does require some technical skills and has no impact on your farming yields, BetterToken is happy to manage your 3Node. Free of charge. 
What CAN you do when you decide to continue to step 4: 
- Rename your farm.
- Add another node to your farm.
- Add a different wallet address to your farm.


## Step 4: Adding your farm to your 3Bot (optional)

1. Head over to our [Farm Setup & Management](farm_management_intro.md) section and complete the steps to add your farm to a 3Bot.
2. Head over to our [ThreeFold Explorer](https://explorer.threefold.io/) to see if your 3Node is up and running by searching your farm name.

## Troubleshooting

### The 3Node does not start after pressing the power button

Please verify the following connections:

1. Between the power adapter and the power cable.
2. Between the power adapter and the “DC-12V” connector.
3. Between the power cable and the outlet.
4. Verify that mains power is available on the wall outlet.

### The 3Node is not showing up on the explorer
1. Make sure your search query is correctly spelled when searching your farm name (please toggle "show offline nodes" when doing so).
2. Make sure your network connection is healthy and up and there are no outages in your area.
