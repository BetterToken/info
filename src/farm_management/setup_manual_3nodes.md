**Congratulations on becoming a Threefold Farmer!**
In order to add your 3Node to the Threefold Grid a few steps
need to be taken. Once completed you will be able to see the status of your 3Node. If you have any additional questions or issues, feel free to contact

Verify package contents:

1. Connect the power cable to the power adapter.
2. Connect the power adapter to the “DC-12V” connector at the back of the 3Node.

PLEASE NOTE: A 3Node should always be placed on a dust free and flat service located close to your home modem (not provided by Threefold). The 3Node is designed to be exposed to in-house conditions and should never be placed in direct sunlight, extreme temperatures (hot/cold) or humid areas.

## Step 3: Adding your farm to your 3Bot

1. Head over to our [Farm Setup & Management](farm_management_intro.md) section and complete the steps to add your farm to a 3bot.
2. Head over to our [ThreeFold Explorer](https://explorer.grid.tf) to see if your 3Node is up and running by searching your farm name.

## Troubleshooting

### The 3Node is does not start after pressing the power button?

Please Verify the following connections:

1. Between the power adapter and the power cable
2. Between the power adapter and the “DC-12V” connector
3. Between the power cable and the outlet
4. Verify that mains power is available on the wall outlet

### The 3Node is not showing up on the explorer
1. Make sure your search query is correctly spelled when searching your farm name (please toggle "show offline nodes" when doing so).
2. Make sure your network connection is healthy and up and there are no outages in your area.
