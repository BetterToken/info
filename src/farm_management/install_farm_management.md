# Install the Farm Management Application

Install the farm management application. To do so, click the `Farm Management` tab on the left side menu.
Then click the `Install now` button

Once the package is installed, the page will reload and the `farm management` UI will appear.

This is where your farm will show up once we have assigned the farm to your 3bot ID.
