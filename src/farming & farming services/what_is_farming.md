# Farming: Putting Capacity Online On The ThreeFold Grid

## What is a Farmer?
The ThreeFold Grid is formed by ThreeFold farmers - individuals or businesses who connect compute and storage hardware (also known as servers) called 3Nodes to the ThreeFold Grid. The compute and storage capacity of 3Nodes mint ThreeFold Tokens for the Farmer as a reward. Once the farmerâ€™s capacity on the ThreeFold Grid gets reserved by a user he gets ThreeFold Tokens. This is called capacity cultivation income.

## Types of ThreeFold Farmers

There are two types of ThreeFold Farmers

- Certified Farmer: Buys certified hardware and signs a contract with ThreeFold Tech for support.
- Do It Yourself (DIY) Farmer: Uses any hardware and in case of support uses online material only.

Note that the ThreeFold Foundation's sole purposes is to ensure the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid and its ecosystem according to it's vision and values. To fund these activites, a part of each transaction that pays TFTs for cultivation is going to the ThreeFold Foundation to finance the ThreeFold Grid's expansion and to fund projects that are believed to bring a positive human or planet impact.

## What is a 3Node

A 3Node is in its essence a server that is installed with Zero-OS.
The formfactor, size, and hardware specs can very from very large (datacenter nodes) to very small (no bigger than a modern modem).
The hardware specifications of a 3Node are one of the factors that determine the amount of ThreeFold the device will farm.

## Plug & Farm
All small nodes that BetterToken ships to its customers are what we call 'plug & farm'. 
This means the node has already been installed and configured to farm for the customer.
There are just 2 very simple steps the customer needs to take.

1. Plug the node into power outlet
2. Provide the node with internet access

The node will be recognized by the ThreeFold Grid and get listed as available capacity.
As long as the 3Node stays online it will farm tokens.
